%
%Thank you for interesting in {\autor}'s {\Bezeichnung}.\\
%This is a control unit for PCs, which can emulate keyboard and mouse
%actions and is inspired on the gaming controllers of various game 
%consoles. It is based on the Arduino board \textit{Esplora} which is
%technically a \textit{Arduino Leonardo} and it already contains some
%sensors and actuators. The printed circuit board was designed roughly in
%the form of a gaming controller.

%\section{Remarks to a genderwise correctly written text}
%Grammatical gender differentiation is very unusual in English language
%compared to German language. In  German speaking countries there is
%currently a trend of \textit{political correctness} to mix the
%grammatical gender with the biological sex. This results in
%\textit{genderwise correctly} written texts which are sometimes really
%difficult to read.\\
%This translation isn't affected by this German gender trend anyway. So
%this may be regarded as a typical German problem \smiley{wink}

%\section{Abstract} % Brief Description
%The {\Bezeichnung} is a control unit with USB2.0 connection inspired by
%the game console based gaming controllers. Instead of proprietary
%signals this device transmits keyboard and mouse commands when the user
%actuates the switches of the device.
%
%Due to its open-source and free programming, it can be adapted to many
%applications in the source code by assigning the desired keyboard codes
%or mouse commands to the control elements (sensors) of the device.
%
%There are eight different assignments (so-called modes) for several
%applications which can be switched during operation. The selected 
%assignment is indicated by the colour of the three-colour LED on the
%Esplora board.
%
%The software of the {\Bezeichnung} emulates a USB keyboard and a USB
%mouse and can be used immediately on most of the PC operating systems
%like \textit{Windows} or \textit{GNU/Linux} as well as on a {\RPi} under
%\textit{Raspbian} without any additional driver installation.
